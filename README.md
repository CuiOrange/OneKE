## üåüOverview

<img src="./figs/main.png" alt="method" style="zoom: 50%;" />

**OneKE** is a dockerized schema-guided knowledge extraction system, which can extract knowledge from the Web and raw PDF Books, and support various domains (science, news, etc.). Specifically, we design **OneKE** with multiple agents and a configure knowledge base. Different agents perform their respective roles, enabling support for various extraction scenarios. The configure knowledge base facilitates schema configuration, error case debugging and correction, further improving the performance. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate OneKE‚Äôs efficacy, while case studies further elucidate its adaptability to diverse tasks across multiple domains, highlighting its potential for broad applications.

## üöÄQuick-Start
### Start with YAML

### Start with Python

<!-- ## ‚úèÔ∏èSelf-Instruct

We conduct self-instruct on Meta-Agent to acquire a sufficient amount of task data and provide an ample training resource. 

```bash
python Self_Instruct/data_generation.py \
    --source_data Self_Instruct/Meta_sample/Meta_Hotpotqa.json \
    --target_data Self_Instruct/hotpotqa_metaqa.json \
    --dataset_name hotpotqa  \
    --generate_all_num 800 \
    --generate_per_round_num 10 \
    --model_name llama-2-13b-chat \
```

The `source_data` contains data examples from the target task information. The `target_data` consists of data generated through self-instruct. The variable `generate_all_num` represents the total number of generated data instances. In order to improve generation efficiency and avoid duplication, we generate `generate_per_round_num` data instances per round.



## üìùSelf-Planning

### Automatic Tool Selection

With the tool library at hand, we ask the Meta-Agent to select applicable tools for each task automatically.

```bash
python Self_Planning/Tool_Selection/tool_selected.py \
    --model_name llama-2-13b-chat \
    --task_name ScienceQA \
    --top_k 40 \
    --top_p 0.75 \
    --max_tokens 1024 \
    --tool_save_path Self_Planning/Tool_Selection/{task_name}_Tools.json
```

The information of the selected tools will be stored in `tool_save_path`.



### Trajectories Synthesis

```bash
python Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/run_task.py \
    --agent_name ZeroshotThink_HotPotQA_run_Agent \
    --llm_name llama-2-13b-chat \
    --max_context_len 4096 \
    --task Hotpotqa \
    --task_path Self_Instruct/hotpotqa_metaqa.json \
    --save_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output/hotpotqa_train_data.jsonl
```

In order to obtain high-quality synthesized trajectories, we filter out all the trajectories with $\texttt{reward}<1$ and collect trajectories with exactly correct answers ($\texttt{reward}=1$) as the training source for self-differentiation. We release the trajectories synthesized by Llama-{13,70}b-chat after filtering in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sh6Ksj8T0fT23ePWRf_dDcOTmpZlulr2?usp=sharing) (but you should also run `filter_data.py` for trajectory differentiation).

```bash
python Scripts/filter_data.py \
    --source_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output/hotpotqa_train_data.jsonl \
    --save_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output \
    --task_name HotpotQA \
    --filter_num 200
```



### Self-Differentiation

In order to establish a clear *division-of-labor*, we leverage synthesized planning trajectories to differentiate the Meta-Agent into three sub-agents with distinct functionalities:

- **Plan-Agent** undertakes task decomposition and determines which tool to invoke in each planning loop.
- **Tool-Agent** is responsible for how to invoke the tool by deciding the parameters for the tool invocation.
- **Reflect-Agent** engages in reflection by considering all the historical trajectories and providing a reflection result.

Agent training:

```bash
for agent in plan tool reflect
do
echo "####################"
echo $agent
echo "####################"
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 deepspeed Self_Plan/Train/train_lora.py \
    --model_name_or_path llama-2-13b-chat \
    --lora_r 8 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --lora_dropout 0.05 \
    --data_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output/data_$agent.json \
    --output_dir Self_Plan/Train/lora/HotpotQA/13b-$agent-5-epoch \
    --num_train_epochs 5 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 10000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fp16 True \
    --model_max_length 4096 \
    --gradient_checkpointing True \
    --q_lora False \
    --deepspeed Self_Plan/Train/deepspeed_config_s3.json \
    --resume_from_checkpoint False 
done
```



### Group Planning

After obtaining the task-specific sub-agents, any new question is processed through group planning among the sub-agents to achieve the desired outcome.

```bash
python Self_Planning/Group_Planning/run_eval.py \
    --agent_name ZeroshotThink_HotPotQA_run_Agent \
    --plan_agent plan \
    --tool_agent tool \
    --reflect_agent reflect \
    --max_context_len 4096 \
    --task HotpotQA \
    --task_path Self_Planning/Group_Planning/benchmark_run/data/hotpotqa \
    --save_path Self_Planning/Group_Planning/output/13b
```

We release the trajectories of text sets generated by Llama-{7,13,70}b-chat in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sh6Ksj8T0fT23ePWRf_dDcOTmpZlulr2?usp=sharing).
