## üåüOverview

**OneKE** is a dockerized schema-guided knowledge extraction system, which can extract knowledge from the Web and raw PDF Books, and support various domains (science, news, etc.). **OneKE** features *multiple agents* and a configurable *knowledge base*. Different agents perform their respective roles, enabling support for various extraction scenarios. The configure knowledge base facilitates schema configuration, error case debugging and correction, further improving the performance. We hope OneKE can serve as a helpful tool for researchers and engineers engaging in knowledge extraction with LLMs.

## üõ†Ô∏èInstallation
OneKE supports both manual and docker image environment configuration, choose your preferred method to build.
### Manual Environment Configuration
Conda virtual environments offer a light and flexible setup.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zjunlp/OneKE.git
cd OneKE
conda create -n oneke python=3.9
conda activate oneke
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Building With Docker Image
Docker image provides greater reliability and stability.
```bash
# Map necessary local files to docker container
# Use container paths in code and execution
git clone https://github.com/zjunlp/OneKE.git
docker pull zjunlp/oneke:v1
docker run --gpus all \
  -v ./OneKE:/app/OneKE \
  -v your_local_model_path:/app/model/your_model_name \
  -it oneke /bin/bash
```
## üöÄQuick-Start
### Start with YAML
#### Prepare the configuration file
Several YAML configuration files are available in the `examples/config` directory for each of the five extraction tasks described in section [Extraction Task Support](#extraction-task-support). These extraction scenarios cover different extraction data, methods, and models, allowing you to easily explore all the features of OneKE.

Here is the configuration file for the web news knowledge extraction scenario:
```yaml
model:
  category: DeepSeek
  model_name_or_path: deepseek-chat
  api_key: your_api_key 
  base_url: https://api.deepseek.com

extraction:             
  task: Base
  instruction: Extract key information from the given text.
  file_path: ./data/input_files/Tulsi_Gabbard_News.html
  output_schema: NewsReport
  use_file: true
  mode: customized
  update_case: false
```
You can choose an existing configuration file or customize the extraction settings as you wish. Note that when using an API service like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, please enter your API key.

#### Run the shell script
First, enter the `OneKE` directory to make sure all subsequent commands are executed there:
```bash
cd OneKE
```
Next, specify the configuration file path and run the code to start the extraction process.
```bash
config_file=your_yaml_file_path
python src/run.py --config $config_file
```

### Start with Python
You can also try OneKE by directly running the `example.py` file located in the `example` directory. Specifically, execute the following commands:
```bash
cd OneKE
python example.py
```

This will complete a basic NER task, with the extraction results printed upon completion. You can further modify the code in `example.py` to suit your extraction task setting or to access detailed extraction trajectory.

Specifically, in the `example.py` file:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("./src")
from models import *
from pipeline import *
import json

# model configuration
model = ChatGPT(model_name_or_path="gpt-4o-mini", api_key="your_api_key")
pipeline = Pipeline(model)

# extraction configuration
Task = "NER"
Text = "Finally , every other year , ELRA organizes a major conference LREC , the International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference ."
Constraint = ["nationality", "country capital", "place of death", "children", "location contains", "place of birth", "place lived", "administrative division of country", "country of administrative divisions", "company", "neighborhood of", "company founders"]

# get extraction result
result, trajectory = pipeline.get_extract_result(task=Task, text=Text, constraint=Constraint)
print("Trajectory:", json.dumps(trajectory, indent=4))
```
First, select an appropriate extraction model, then complete the configuration of extraction parameters (such as extraction task, extraction text, etc.). Finally, call the `get_extract_result` function of the `Pipeline` class to perform information extraction and obtain the final results.

<!-- ### Start with online service
We have developed a frontend demo for OneKE, which allows you to try information extraction in an intuitive and convenient way. Website link: [OneKE-demo]()

> Note: To ensure extraction efficiency and data security, the demo only displays OneKE's basic extraction capabilities. 
For advanced features like error correction and reflection, please consider the options mentioned above. -->

<!-- ## ‚úèÔ∏èSelf-Instruct

We conduct self-instruct on Meta-Agent to acquire a sufficient amount of task data and provide an ample training resource. 

```bash
python Self_Instruct/data_generation.py \
    --source_data Self_Instruct/Meta_sample/Meta_Hotpotqa.json \
    --target_data Self_Instruct/hotpotqa_metaqa.json \
    --dataset_name hotpotqa  \
    --generate_all_num 800 \
    --generate_per_round_num 10 \
    --model_name llama-2-13b-chat \
```

The `source_data` contains data examples from the target task information. The `target_data` consists of data generated through self-instruct. The variable `generate_all_num` represents the total number of generated data instances. In order to improve generation efficiency and avoid duplication, we generate `generate_per_round_num` data instances per round.



## üìùSelf-Planning

### Automatic Tool Selection

With the tool library at hand, we ask the Meta-Agent to select applicable tools for each task automatically.

```bash
python Self_Planning/Tool_Selection/tool_selected.py \
    --model_name llama-2-13b-chat \
    --task_name ScienceQA \
    --top_k 40 \
    --top_p 0.75 \
    --max_tokens 1024 \
    --tool_save_path Self_Planning/Tool_Selection/{task_name}_Tools.json
```

The information of the selected tools will be stored in `tool_save_path`.



### Trajectories Synthesis

```bash
python Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/run_task.py \
    --agent_name ZeroshotThink_HotPotQA_run_Agent \
    --llm_name llama-2-13b-chat \
    --max_context_len 4096 \
    --task Hotpotqa \
    --task_path Self_Instruct/hotpotqa_metaqa.json \
    --save_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output/hotpotqa_train_data.jsonl
```

In order to obtain high-quality synthesized trajectories, we filter out all the trajectories with $\texttt{reward}<1$ and collect trajectories with exactly correct answers ($\texttt{reward}=1$) as the training source for self-differentiation. We release the trajectories synthesized by Llama-{13,70}b-chat after filtering in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sh6Ksj8T0fT23ePWRf_dDcOTmpZlulr2?usp=sharing) (but you should also run `filter_data.py` for trajectory differentiation).

```bash
python Scripts/filter_data.py \
    --source_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output/hotpotqa_train_data.jsonl \
    --save_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output \
    --task_name HotpotQA \
    --filter_num 200
```



### Self-Differentiation

In order to establish a clear *division-of-labor*, we leverage synthesized planning trajectories to differentiate the Meta-Agent into three sub-agents with distinct functionalities:

- **Plan-Agent** undertakes task decomposition and determines which tool to invoke in each planning loop.
- **Tool-Agent** is responsible for how to invoke the tool by deciding the parameters for the tool invocation.
- **Reflect-Agent** engages in reflection by considering all the historical trajectories and providing a reflection result.

Agent training:

```bash
for agent in plan tool reflect
do
echo "####################"
echo $agent
echo "####################"
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 deepspeed Self_Plan/Train/train_lora.py \
    --model_name_or_path llama-2-13b-chat \
    --lora_r 8 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --lora_dropout 0.05 \
    --data_path Self_Plan/Traj_Syn/output/data_$agent.json \
    --output_dir Self_Plan/Train/lora/HotpotQA/13b-$agent-5-epoch \
    --num_train_epochs 5 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 10000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fp16 True \
    --model_max_length 4096 \
    --gradient_checkpointing True \
    --q_lora False \
    --deepspeed Self_Plan/Train/deepspeed_config_s3.json \
    --resume_from_checkpoint False 
done
```



### Group Planning

After obtaining the task-specific sub-agents, any new question is processed through group planning among the sub-agents to achieve the desired outcome.

```bash
python Self_Planning/Group_Planning/run_eval.py \
    --agent_name ZeroshotThink_HotPotQA_run_Agent \
    --plan_agent plan \
    --tool_agent tool \
    --reflect_agent reflect \
    --max_context_len 4096 \
    --task HotpotQA \
    --task_path Self_Planning/Group_Planning/benchmark_run/data/hotpotqa \
    --save_path Self_Planning/Group_Planning/output/13b
```

We release the trajectories of text sets generated by Llama-{7,13,70}b-chat in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sh6Ksj8T0fT23ePWRf_dDcOTmpZlulr2?usp=sharing).
